Data: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking

The challenge here is to figure out the best candies that could be offered for Halloween as per people's choices. We already have win percentage for certain candies and we now furtherr explore what factors contribute most to high win percentage. 


Data is thus analysed using Linear Regression, Clustering Techniques and even with Random Forest to check out importance features.

Statistical analysis like Hypothesis Testing and visualization plots are also looked into.

To find out more, please refer the code files attached.

To summarize, we can note that candies with high concentration of chocolate combined with nuttiness and crispiness seems to be devooured more.
